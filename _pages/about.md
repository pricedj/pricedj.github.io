I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) in the [Space Physics Research Group](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/spacephysics/) where I investigate magnetic flux ropes formed in the solar corona. The bulk of this work has been carried out as part of the project to unravel the structure of solar flux ropes and their magnetosheath ([SolMAG](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/solmag-erc/)) and now continues as part of the solar energetic particle analysis platform for the inner heliosphere ([SERPENTINE](https://serpentine-h2020.eu/)) project. Additionally, I am the current Vice-Chair of the [Finnish Physical Society](https://www.fyysikkoseura.fi/language/en/).
